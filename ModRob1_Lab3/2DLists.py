# this is an example of a 2D lists
# 2D lists --> lists inside lists

# lets create a 3*3 matrix using 2D lists

matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
print(matrix)
# this matrix has 3 rows and 3 columns

# we can access individual elements within a 2D list using the row and column indices 
# the indices start from 0 

# we want to access the element in the first row and first column:
print(matrix[0][0])

# how about in the second row and third column?
print(matrix[1][2])
