# Modern Robotics I, Lab 9: Python Code for All the Math from Lesson 3 up to Lesson 6
This folder contains all the code for Lab 9. The work distribution worked as follows:
- Parts 1 - 6: Wilfredo Robinson
- Parts 7 - 10: Namrata Roy
- Parts 11 - 13: Long-Tai Chen
- Parts 14 - 15: Bryan MacGavin 

Since the latter code snippets were much more challenging than the earlier ones, the group considered this was the most balanced way of distributing the work.
