# Modern Robotics I: Project I
This repo includes all the code for Project I:
- package.xml includes how we modified ROS2's joint commands to be velocity commands instead of position commands.
- px100_jac_ex.py is the main file in this project and shows how we obtained our real velocity, our theoretical velocity, our error between velocities, and how we made our robot dance.
- px100_jacobian.m shows the MATLAB code we used to obtain the space Jacobians of each of the joints and the final robot Jacobian.
- setup.py is just a backup for the settings of the vel_tut package we created in ROS2 for this project.
